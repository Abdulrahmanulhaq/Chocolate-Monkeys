        <p><i>Chocolate Monkeys is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network.
          This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are
          entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and
          validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore,
          as the Chocolate Monkeys smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to
          undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</i>
          </p>
        <p><b>1. OWNERSHIP</b></p>
        <p>A. You Own the NFT. Each Chocolate Monkey is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When
          you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Chocolate Ape, the Art, completely. Ownership
          of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point
          may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Chocolate Monkey.
          
          <br><br>B. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Chocolate Monkey
          Candy Shop LLC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the
          purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely forthe
          following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace
          that permits the purchase and sale of your Chocolate Monkey / NFT, provided that the
          marketplace cryptographically verifies each Chocolate Monkeys owner’s rights to display the
          Art for their Chocolate Monkey to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii)
          as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
          participation of your Chocolate Monkey, provided that the website/application cryptographically
          verifies each Bored Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Chocolate Monkey to ensure
          that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once
          the owner of the Chocolate Monkeys leaves the website/application.
          
          <br><br>C. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Chocolate
          Monkeys Candy Shop LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display
          the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial
          Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell
          merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing
          in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that
          permits the use and sale of Bored Apes generally, provided that the marketplace
          cryptographically verifies each Chocolate Monkeys owner’s rights to display the Art for their
          Chocolate Monkeys to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or
          operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
          participation of Chocolate Monkeys generally, provided that the third party website or
          application cryptographically verifies each Chocolate Monkeys owner’s rights to display the Art
          for their Chocolate Monkeys to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and
          provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Chocolate Monkeys
          leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.

          <br><br>D. Chocolate Monkeys IP. Other than the rights to the Art, nothing herein gives you any rights
          to any other trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to Chocolate Monkeys
          Candy Shop including, without limitation, to Chocolate Monkeys, The Candy Shop, Chocolate
          Monkeys Candy Shop, and the associated logos. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the
          name of Chocolate Monkeys Candy Shop LLC.

          <br><br>E. Feedback. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about
          the Site, including without limitation about how to improve the Site (collectively, “Feedback”).
          By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback in any way we
          choose without additional compensation to you and you hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable,
          nonexclusive, worldwide license to incorporate and use the Feedback for any purpose.
          
        
        </p>

        <p><b>2. Your Responsibilities:
        </b></p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the Site, and for any
          consequences thereof. You agree to use the Site only for purposes that are legal, proper and in
          accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations. By way of example, and
          not as a limitation, you may not, and may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute
          or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, hateful, violent,
          obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; (ii) distribute viruses, worms, defects, Trojan
          horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature; (iii)
          impersonate another person; (iv) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the
          Site any content that infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any party or
          otherwise violates the legal rights of others; (v) engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity
          (including, without limitation, money laundering); (vi) interfere with other users' use of the Site;
          (vii) use the Site for any unauthorized commercial purpose; (viii) modify, adapt, translate, or
          reverse engineer any portion of the Site; (ix) remove any copyright, trademark or other
          proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Site or any part of it; (x) use any technology to
          collect information about the Site’s for any unauthorized purpose; (xi) access or use the Site for
          the purpose of creating a product or service that is competitive with any of our products or
          services. If you engage in any of the activities prohibited by this Section, we may, at our sole and
          absolute discretion, without notice to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or
          remedies at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate your user account.
          
        </p>

        <p><b>3. Fees and Payment</b>
        </p>
        <p>A. If you elect to purchase a Chocolate Monkeys through the Site, any financial transactions that
          you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight
          into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any
          transactions. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages
          that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you
          conduct via the Ethereum network.</p>

          <br><br>B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that
          occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the
          decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each
          transaction. 

        </p>

            </p>
              <p><b>6. Risk Assumption
              </b></p>
        <p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
          
          <br><br>A. To the extent that you sell your Chocolate Monkeys NFT, please be aware that the prices of
          NFTs are extremely volatile and fluctuations in the prices of other NFTs and impact the price of
          your Chocolate Monkeys both positively and negatively. Given the volatility, NFTs such as
          Chocolate Monkeys should not be considered an investment. You assume all risks in that
          connection.
          
          <br><br>B. Ownership of a Chocolate Monkeys confers ownership of digital artwork only. Accordingly,
          no information on this Site (or any other documents mentioned therein) is or may be considered
          to be advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any investment purpose. Further,
          nothing on this Site qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction nor
          does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial
          products. Due to the artistic nature of the project, Chocolate Monkeys has not been registered
          with or approved by any regulator in any jurisdiction. It remains your sole responsibility to
          assure that the purchase of the Chocolate Monkeys and the associated art is in compliance with
          laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

          <br><br>C. You assume all risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not
          limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software
          introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored
          within your wallet.

          <br><br>D. NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are relatively new and the regulatory
          landscape is unsettled. New regulations could negatively impact such technologies impacting
          the value for your Chocolate Monkeys. You understand and accept all risk in that regard.

          <br><br>E. You assume all responsibility for any adverse effects of disruptions or other issues impacting
          Ethereum or the Ethereum platform.
          
        
        </p>

        <p><b>7. Indemnification</b>
        </p>
        <p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Chocolate Monkeys and its subsidiaries, affiliates,
          officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any
          claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment,
          litigation cost, and reasonable attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to (i) your
          breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the Site, or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules
          or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the Site.

        </p>

        <p><b>8. Changes to the Terms and Conditions</b>
        </p>
        <p>We may make changes to the Terms at our discretion. Please check these Terms periodically for
          changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued
          access to or use after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the
          updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the Site.
        </p>

        <p><b>9. Children</b>
        </p>
        <p>Our Site is not intended for children. You must be at least 18 years old to access this Site or
          purchase a Chocolate Monkeys. If you are under 18 years old you are not permitted to use this
          Site for any reason. By accessing the Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18
          years of age.
        </p>

        <p><b>10. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</b>
        </p>
        <p>All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your
          access or use of the Site, or to any products sold or distributed through the Site, will be referred
          to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
          The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the American
          Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable rules. Each party will cover its own
          fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings. The place of arbitration will be
          Madison, Wisconsin. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on
          the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in
          any court of competent jurisdiction.

          <br><br>WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS,
          INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THE SITE OR ANY
          PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE SITE, OR THE SMART
          CONTRACTS: (I) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A
          TRIAL BY JURY; AND (II) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
          PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT,
          INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY
          SUCH DISPUTE.
